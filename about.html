            <p>
                My name is Thomas, I'm 12 years old(close to 13). My goal is to become a cybersecurity engineer(because it's a really high paying job).
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm actually kinda interested in the Cybersecurity world because its REALLY powerful. And since AI is here, It's even easier and better.
            </p>
            <p>
                I play games(specifically Roblox). Used to code, but dont do it anymore(cuz AI can just do it for me obviously).
            </p>
            <p>
                Thats pretty much it for me, besides me saying I don't like cheese on pizza, but I like cheese on other stuff. Is that weird? idk.
